# System-Theory---2
The system theory project num. 2
The task was to create the dynamic line that will pass through the x_0 point with the given matrices that describes the dynamics of move ( A, B, C, D, E) where T was the period that should be less or equal to 1 so that the limit will exist.

Remark:  in order to make the windows form work, please, change from 0,02 to 0.02.

The blue line depicts a similar dynamics (the best according to a chosen criteria) which is more stable comparing to the initial one.
